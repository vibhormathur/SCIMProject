# SCIM

## Requirements
Write a SCIM 2.0 server including 7 necessary requests used by identity providers using Scala on the Play framework. You'll have design a database to define users, groups, and user-group membership. The API needs no presentation layer, just RESTful endpoints that can manipulate the database and return JSON. The repository contains a template for the project, including routes and a controller to get you started.
